<p>The imports part of a file should be handled by the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), not manually by the developer.</p>
<p>Unused and useless imports should not occur if that is the case.</p>
<p>Leaving them in reduces the code's readability, since their presence can be confusing.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
@import 'a.css';
@import 'a.css'; // Noncompliant

@import url("a.css");
@import url("a.css"); // Noncompliant
</pre>

<p>An invalid color definition will by default be interpreted as black, which is likely to have unintended impacts on the expected look and feel of
the website.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a color definition <code>color, background-color) is not valid. The color definition is considered valid when it is
made of hexadecimal characters:</code></p>
<code> <p>- longhand: 6 or 8 characters (when alpha is defined)</p> <p>- shorthand variant: 3 or 4 characters (when alpha is defined)</p> <h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2> <pre>
a {
 color: #3c; // Noncompliant: shorthand should be made of 3 characters
}
div {
  background-color: #3cb371a; // Noncompliant: alpha should have 2 characters
}
</pre> <h2>Compliant Solution</h2> <pre>
a {
 color: #3cc;
}
div {
  background-color: #3cb371ac;
